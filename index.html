                    <p>I am Luyun Song, a graduate of the Central Academy of Drama in China, with over five years of experience in scriptwriting and planning. My passion lies in shooting and editing videos, and I have garnered up to 250,000 views on my personal YouTube channel. Additionally, I have also ventured into the field of graphic design.</br>
                        Outside of work, I have a soft spot for small animals and have cared for three hamsters. I indulge in various outdoor activities such as hiking, fitness training, skiing, and mountaineering. I also have a keen interest in sports like tennis, table tennis, badminton, billiards, and more. Exploring different cuisines at restaurants is something I enjoy on weekends, and I make it a point to travel during my holidays.</br>
                        Combining my experience in theater, video production, and design with my love for outdoor activities, sports, and exploration, I am a well-rounded individual, always eager to embrace new challenges.</p>
